# mlflow-telco-churn
This project aims to design and implement a comprehensive machine learning (ML) system to 
manage the entire lifecycle of an ML model, including experiment tracking, model training, 
parameter tuning, model deployment, and monitoring. The project will utilize MLflow, an opensource platform to manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. Students will select a specific 
domain (e.g., healthcare, finance, retail) and dataset to develop a predictive model and then use 
MLflow to manage the various stages of the ML project lifecycle.
